A [Best Current Practice (BCP)](/bcp/) in the context of the GCVE.eu project is a community-driven guideline that documents recommended procedures, configurations, or operational principles to support the secure, reliable, and consistent implementation of GCVE-related infrastructure, tools, and services.

GCVE.eu has published its first Best Current Practice document, [GCVE-BCP-01](https://gcve.eu/bcp/gcve-bcp-01/), which outlines the recommended method for verifying the integrity and authenticity of the GCVE directory file using OpenSSL and a public key. This BCP ensures that all consumers of the directory validate the fileâ€™s signature before use, reinforcing trust and security within the GCVE ecosystem. All implementers and users are strongly encouraged to follow the outlined verification process. The BCP is a draft for public review. Feedback is more than welcome.
