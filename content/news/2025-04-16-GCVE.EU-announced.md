Introducing the **Global CVE (GCVE) Allocation System** ([https://gcve.eu](https://gcve.eu)), a new decentralized approach to identifying and numbering security vulnerabilities. GCVE empowers independent **GCVE Numbering Authorities (GNAs)** to assign vulnerability IDs directly, offering greater autonomy and speed compared to traditional centralized methods. This system is designed to complement the existing CVEÂ® program, ensuring seamless compatibility by representing all standard CVEs under the reserved `GNA ID 0`.

The primary benefits of GCVE include enhanced **flexibility** for participating organizations to define their own processes, improved **scalability** by removing central bottlenecks, and **decentralized allocation** managed by the GNAs themselves. We invite organizations involved in vulnerability management to explore this new system and consider becoming a GNA.
