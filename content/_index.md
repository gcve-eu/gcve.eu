# GCVE: Global CVE Allocation System

The **Global CVE (GCVE)** allocation system is a new, decentralized approach to vulnerability identification and numbering, designed to improve flexibility, scalability, and autonomy for participating entities. 

While remaining compatible with the traditional CVE system, GCVE introduces **GCVE Numbering Authorities (GNAs)**. GNAs are independent entities that can allocate identifiers without relying on a centralised block distribution system or rigid policy enforcement.
