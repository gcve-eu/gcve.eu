## Details and Information 

The Global CVE (GCVE) allocation system is a new, decentralized approach to vulnerability identification and numbering, designed to improve flexibility, scalability, and autonomy for participating entities.

While remaining compatible with the traditional CVE system, GCVE introduces GCVE Numbering Authorities (GNAs). GNAs are independent entities that can allocate identifiers without relying on a centralised block distribution system or rigid policy enforcement.
